A simple graph library with single-agent pathfinding algorithms, used in my research projects, e.g., [time-independent-planning](https://github.com/Kei18/time-independent-planning), [mapf-IR](https://kei18.github.io/mapf-IR/).
It is written in C++(17) with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (â‰¥v3.16) build.
For usage, see [examples](https://github.com/Kei18/grid-pathfinding/blob/master/tests/test_graph.cpp).

### Mac M1 CPU Support

To build this library for M1 CPUs, you need to add an argument to cmake as such:

``` bash
cmake .. -DCPU=M1
```

You should see an output similar to 

``` text
Configuring grid-pathfinding for M1 Mac.
